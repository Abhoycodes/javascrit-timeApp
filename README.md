# Javascript methods 

The setInterval() method calls a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds).
The setInterval() method continues calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.
1 second = 1000 milliseconds.<br>
**Note :To execute the function only once, use the setTimeout() method instead.**<br>
See the section about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp">setTimeOut()</a> methord.
